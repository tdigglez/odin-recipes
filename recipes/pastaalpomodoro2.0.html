    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>A recipe for pasta with tomato sauce that's saucy, creamy, and perfect for those end of summer tomatoes! If you're craving pasta with tomatoes in the winter, you can sub canned tomatoes for fresh tomatoes.</p>
    
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>

        <li>6 tbsp extra virgin olive oil</li>
        <li>2 large smashed garlic cloves</li>
        <li>5 basil leaves</li>
        <li>3/4 lb cherry tomatoes</li>
        <li>3/4 lb spaghetti (or your pasta of choice)</li>
        <li>~4 tbsp finely grated parmigiano reggiano</li>

    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>

        <li>Wash, dry, then chop the cherry tomatoes into quarters.</li>
        <li>Bring a large pot of water to boil.</li>
        <li>Place the garlic into a small pot. Cover generously with a layer of olive oil and turn heat to low. Cook until right when the garlic starts to turn golden. Usually 2 minutes. Remove from heat.</li>
        <li>Turn pot heat to medium and add cherry tomatoes. Stir and cover. Cook for 18 minutes, stirring every 3 to 5 minutes.</li>
        <li>Add the basil to the tomato sauce. Also add 1 pinch of salt. Cover and continue to cook for 2 minutes. Remove the sauce from heat.</li>
        <li>Use an immersion blender to finely blend the sauce. Blend until smooth as canned tomato soup.</li>
        <li>Generously salt the pasta water, then add pasta. Cook until 3 minutes before ‘al dente’ per package description. Reserve 1 to 2 cups pasta water.</li>
        <li>Add sauce to a large pan and place on low heat while waiting for pasta to cook. Cut the heat if it starts to boil.</li>
        <li>1 minute before adding pasta, add 1 ladle of pasta water to sauce. Turn heat to medium then high. The sauce should begin to boil.</li>
        <li>Add the pasta to the sauce, stirring continuously. Add pasta water 1/2 ladle at a time as the pasta continues to cook and dry out. Cook for the remaining 2 to 3 minutes.</li>
        <li>Remove from heat then add parmigiano reggiano. Stir to incorporate.</li>
        <li>Plate and serve immediately. Don’t forget to finish with a drizzle of extra virgin olive oil!</li>
